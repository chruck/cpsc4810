Robert Underwood

Martin Fowler __Refactoring__ book

"Code Smells" - Martin Fowler
- dupe code
- long methods
- long param lists
- data clumps --> single struct
- primitive obsession - `x` or `i` --> use typedefs
- speculative generality - interfaces for everything, only use one
- incomplete libraries - extensions/wrappers to simplify
- heavy comments
+ magic valuse - const/enum
+ pyramid of death - nested conditionals

Refactoring
---
keep most code
systematic changes
behavior: unchanging

Refactoring Tools
---
- LLVM's libtooling (C, C++)
- Eclim <-- vim using Eclipse for refactoring
- PyCharm, rope
